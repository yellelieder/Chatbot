# Universal Language Chatbot

The bot interacts with users based on written inputs into a simple web frontend. Inputs are translated by [deepl]( https://www.deepl.com) into a custom target language (as defined in config.py). Answeres are generated by [OpenAIs]( https://www.openai.com) GPT-3. The server runs on flask in debug mode. 
## API Keys

To run this project, you will need to add your API key for the following services to the [config](config.py) file:

`https://www.deepl.com/en/docs-api/`

`https://openai.com/api`

They both provide a certain amount of free calls, which are more than sufficient for basic local testing. 


## Configuration
You might want to adjust the bot to your needs. You can do this by changing the values in the [config](config.py) file. Currently, the following values are potentially subject to change:

`target_language` = The language you want your bot to speak. Note that he will understand all language inputs as supported by [deepl](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/other-functions/listing-supported-languages/).

`empty_input_prompt` = What your bot should respond if a user sends an empty message.

## Run Locally

Pre-requisits: Your machine runs [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
In your command prompt: 

Check if Python is installed
```bash
  python --version
  # output like this expected: Python 3.10.4
```
Check if GIT is installed
```bash
  git --version
  # output like this expected: git version 2.35.2.windows.1
```
